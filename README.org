* why

i don't want to buy a ddr pad 

- this project is to make a vr "pad" to press the arrow keys
- in theory it should be able to not only work with full body trackers but also with your controllers 

* amount complete 
currently it gets the positions of the first 2 trackers that are connected and prints out the position matrix

also it places a picture of osu in the middle of your playspace lol

* why

i don't want to buy a ddr pad 

- this project is to make a vr "pad" to press the arrow keys
- in theory it should be able to not only work with full body trackers but also with your controllers 

* amount complete 
currently it gets the positions of the first 2 trackers that are connected and prints out the position matrix

[[./up and down.png]]

/image of a position matrix graphed with viewData.py/

also it places a picture of osu in the middle of your playspace lol

|       | column 1 | column 2 | column 3 | column 4 (position)             |
|-------+----------+----------+----------+---------------------------------|
| row 1 | ???      | ???      | ???      | either x or z, negative is left |
| row 2 | ???      | ???      | ???      | y                               |
| row 3 | ???      | ???      | ???      | x or z, negative is forwards    |

/table showing the value in mDeviceToAbsoluteTracking field in the struct TrackedDevicePose_t actually are/

as you can see i have no idea what most of the numbers are. i assume one of the columns is rotation but after that i have no guesses to what the others are. i really don't understand where i am supposed to find out what these are lol. maybe i was supposed to find that out from some math class in college (i am a highschool student)

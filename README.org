* why

i don't want to buy a ddr pad

- this project is to make a vr "pad" to press the arrow keys
- in theory it should be able to not only work with full body trackers but also with your controllers

* amount complete
currently it gets the positions of the first 2 trackers that are connected and prints out the position matrix

[[./up and down.png]]

/image of a position matrix graphed with viewData.py, numbers are valves m variables from [[https://valvesoftware.github.io/steamvr_unity_plugin/api/Valve.VR.TrackedDevicePose_t.html#Valve_VR_TrackedDevicePose_t_mDeviceToAbsoluteTracking][mDeviceToAbsoluteTracking]] with 1 added to them/

also it places a picture of osu in the middle of your playspace lol

|       | column 1 | column 2 | column 3 | column 4 (position)                |
|-------+----------+----------+----------+------------------------------------|
| row 1 | ??? m0   | ??? m1   | ??? m2   | either x or z, negative is left m3 |
| row 2 | ??? m4   | ??? m5   | ??? m6   | y m7                               |
| row 3 | ??? m8   | ??? m9   | ??? m10  | x or z, negative is forwards m11   |

/table showing what the values in mDeviceToAbsoluteTracking actually are as far as i know/

as you can see i have no idea what most of the numbers are. i assume one of the columns is rotation but after that i have no guesses to what the others are. i really don't understand where i am supposed to find out what these are lol. maybe i was supposed to find that out from some math class in college (i am a highschool student)

notes to figure out the numbers for the areas on the pad
